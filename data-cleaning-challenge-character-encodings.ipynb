Today, we're going to be working with different character encodings. To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n> **Your turn!** As we work through this notebook, you'll see some notebook cells (a block of either code or text) that has \"Your Turn!\" written in it. These are exercises for you to do to help cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\nHere's what we're going to do today:\n\n* [Get our environment set up](#Get-our-environment-set-up)\n* [What are encodings?](#What-are-encodings?)\n* [Reading in files with encoding problems](#Reading-in-files-with-encoding-problems)\n* [Saving your files with UTF-8 encoding](#Saving-your-files-with-UTF-8-encoding)\n\nLet's get started!","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b91a74ba-85f4-486e-b5f9-d0898f0626bf","_uuid":"6ac53f18b4f4ec0fc44348cedb5d1c319fa127c0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Get our environment set up\n________\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries we'll be using.

There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding that the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here's an example of mojibake:\n\næ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n\nYou might also end up with a \"unknown\" characters. There are what gets printed when there's no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding you're using to read your byte string in and they look like this:\n\n����������\n\nCharacter encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n\n> UTF-8 is **the** standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.\n\nIt was pretty hard to deal with encodings in Python 2, but thankfully in Python 3 it's a lot simpler. (Kaggle Kernels only use Python 3.) There are two main data types you'll encounter when working with text in Python 3. One is is the string, which is what text is by default.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"52d1b1fb-b71f-4691-9f49-545bf272354d","_uuid":"06093219f80ef491dd51e776a1c0701badaaf67e"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# start with a string\nbefore = \"This is the euro symbol: €\"\n\n# check to see what datatype it is\ntype(before)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"579e7b4a-9113-4795-833f-43dfaa7bd223","_uuid":"c93b6c3d188e2174d5060255ea6220f52026d6f2","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-18T18:27:39.223625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-18T18:27:39.224060Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-18T18:27:39.231225Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-18T18:27:39.224018Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-18T18:27:39.230454Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The other data is the [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#bytes) data type, which is a sequence of integers.

We didn't do quite as much coding, but  take my word for it: if you don't have the right tools, figuring out what encoding a file is in can be a huge time sink. If you have any questions, be sure to post them in the comments below or [on the forums](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers). \n\nRemember that your notebook is private by default, and in order to share it with other people or ask for help with it, you'll need to make it public. First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also lets you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# More practice!\n___\n\nCheck out [this dataset of files in different character encodings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/character-encoding-examples). Can you read in all the files with their original encodings and them save them out as UTF-8 files?\n\nIf you have a file that's in UTF-8 but has just a couple of weird-looking characters in it, you can try out the [ftfy module](https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and see if it helps.
